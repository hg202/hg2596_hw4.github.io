Contribution: Previously, the best method of monitoring HIV incidence was by conducting cross-section surveys, starting with HIV-negative individuals, and following them until they got HIV. However, these population-based approaches are costly and require a lot of resources. Our study aimed to use a clinical-based approach where HIV recency testing such as RTRI (Rapid Test for Recent Infections) and RITA (Recent Test Algorithm) will estimate proxy incidence. Our results showed RITA coverage increased over time and the proxy incidence for HIV remained steady. In other regions where incidence is greater, it might be critical for monitoring tools to include proxy incidence to better reveal HIV incidence.
