As a first-generation graduate, I've seen how profoundly social factors can impact an individual's physical health. I am determined to utilize statistical analysis tools to contribute to advancing public health, particularly within my community and for the <strong> most vulnerable</strong>.

After getting my degree in Epidemiology with a certificate of Biostatistics, I hope to use the skills that I have learned in both fields to help advocate for peopleâ€™s health. One of the ways I would like to do that is by being a Data Scientist in a very much needed Epidemiology field. 

If you want to learn more about my experiences, here is a link to my [resume](resume.html) page. 

Additionally, if you are interested in looking at some plots, here is a link to my [dashboard](dashboard.html).
